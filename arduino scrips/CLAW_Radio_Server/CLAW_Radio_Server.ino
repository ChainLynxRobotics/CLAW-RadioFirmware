   Create a BLE server that, once we receive a connection, will send periodic notifications.
   The service advertises itself as: 4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b
   And has a characteristic of: beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8

   The design of creating the BLE server is:
   1. Create a BLE Server
   2. Create a BLE Service
   3. Create a BLE Characteristic on the Service
   4. Create a BLE Descriptor on the characteristic
   5. Start the service.
   6. Start advertising.

   A connect hander associated with the server starts a background task that performs notification
   every couple of seconds.
